## Temporal evolution of the effective network in the Deffuant opinion dynamics model

This repo contains the code used for the final project in the course Complex Social Networks (CSN) at UPC.

The repo includes code and results from simulations of the evolution percolation in the effective network of the Deffuant bounded confidence model.

Three notebooks are included which feature the following content.

* `deffuant_effective_network _graph_tool.ipynb` contains the main work of the project with efficient simulations
* `bounded_confidence_social_networks.ipynb` reproduces the results of GÃ©rard Weisbuch in his paper "Bounded confidence and Social networks"
* `plot functions.ipynb` includes code for plotting the results of our report.

In the folder `results.zip` we find the results used to generate the figures in our paper.

The simulations were run on linux with the conda enviroment specified in the file `environment.yml`
